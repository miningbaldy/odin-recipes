        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>      4 large bell peppers(any color)</li>
            <li>      1 lb lean(at least 80%) ground beef</li>
            <li>      2 tablespons chopped onion</li>
            <li>      1 cup cooked rice</li>
            <li>      1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>      1 clove garlic, finely chopped</li>
            <li>      1 can(15 oz) Muir Glen organic tomato sauce</li>
            <li>    3/4 cup shredded mozzarella cheese(3 oz)</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oven to 350F</li>
            <li>Cut thin slice from stem end of each bell pepper to remove top of pepper. Remove seeds<br>
                and membranes; rinse peppers. If necessary, cut thin slice from bottom of each pepper<br>
                so they stand up straight. In 4-quart Dutch oven, add enough water to cover peppers.<br>
                Heat to boiling; add peppers. Cook about 2 minutes; drain.
            </li>
            <li>In 10-inch skillet, cook beef and onion over medium heat 8 to 10 minutes, stirring<br>
                occasionally, until beef is brown; drain. Stir in rice, salt, garlic and 1 cup of the tomato<br>
                sauce; cook until hot.
            </li>
            <li>Stuff peppers with beef mixture. Stand peppers upright in ungreased 8-inch square glass<br>
                baking dish. Pour remaining tomato sauce over peppers.
            </li>
            <li> Cover tightly with foil. Bake 10 minutes. Uncover and bake about 15 minutes longer or<br>
                until peppers are tender. Sprinkle with cheese.
            </li>
        </ol>
