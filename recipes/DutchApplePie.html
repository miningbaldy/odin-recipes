        <h3>Dutch Apple Pie</h3>
        <p>The difference between classic apple pie and a Dutch apple pie recipe is all in<br>
            the delicious crumb topping. Dutch apple pie topping is made with butter, Gold<br>
            Medal™ flour, brown sugar and granulated sugar, and you'll know when it's<br> ready to come out of the oven when the crumb toppings are a deep golden<br>
            brown. Instead of a second pie crust, enjoy a generous blanket of sweet streusel<br>
            crumbs–sprinkled over a tender spiced apple filling.</p>
            
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <h4>  Crust</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>     1 cup Gold Medal all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>   1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>   1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon shortening</li>
            <li>     2 to 3 tablespoons cold water</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>  Filling</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>     8 cups sliced cored peeled apples</li>
            <li>   1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>   1/4 cup Gold Medal all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>   1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>     1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>  Topping</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>   1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
            <li>     1 cup Gold Medal all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>   2/3 cup packed brown sugar</li>
            <li>     1 tablespoon granulated sugar</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In medium bowl, mix 1 cup flour and the salt. Cut in shortening, using pastry blender (or<br>
                pulling 2 table knives through ingredients in opposite directions), until particles are size<br>
                of small peas. Sprinkle with cold water, 1 tablespoon at a time, tossing with fork until all<br>
                flour is moistened and pastry almost leaves side of bowl (1 to 2 teaspoons more water<br>
                can be added if necessary). Gather pastry into a ball. Shape into flattened round on<br>
                lightly floured surface. Wrap flattened round of pastry in plastic wrap, and refrigerate<br>
                about 45 minutes or until dough is firm and cold, yet pliable. This allows the shortening<br>
                to become slightly firm, which helps make the baked pastry more flaky. If refrigerated<br>
                longer, let pastry soften slightly before rolling.
            </li>
            <li>Heat oven to 400°F. On surface sprinkled with flour, using floured rolling pin, roll pastry<br>
                dough into circle 2 inches larger than 9-inch pie plate. Fold pastry into fourths; place in<br>
                pie plate. Unfold and ease into plate, pressing firmly against bottom and side and being<br>
                careful not to stretch pastry, which will cause it to shrink when baked. Trim overhanging<br>
                edge of pastry 1 inch from rim of pie plate. Fold and roll pastry under, even with plate;<br>
                flute as desired.
            </li>
            <li>In large bowl, toss Filling ingredients. Pour into pie plate, mounding apples toward<br>
                center.</li>
            <li>In medium bowl, use pastry blender or fingers to mix butter, 1 cup flour and the brown<br>
                sugar until a crumb forms. Sprinkle evenly over top of pie. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon<br>
                granulated sugar on top.
            </li>
            <li>Bake 45 to 55 minutes or until pie crust and crumb topping are deep golden brown and<br>
                filling begins to bubble. Transfer to cooling rack to cool.
            </li>
