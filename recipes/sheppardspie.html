        <h3>Shepherd's Pie</h3>
        <p>Shepherd's Pie is a traditionally Irish Dish. It is usually made with ground <br>
           lamb but for convenience sake it can be made with ground beef. Aside from beef<br>
            or lamb a filling of mash potatoes is usually put on top of the meat. The meat is<br>
           also mixed with mixed vegetables such as corn, peas and carrots.

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <h4>Make the Meat Filling.</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the oil to a large skillet and place it<br>
                over medium-high heat for 2 minutes.<br>
                Add the onions. Cook 5 minutes,<br>
                stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Add the ground beef (or ground lamb)<br>
                to the skillet and break it apart with a <br>
                wooden spoon. Add the parsley,<br>
                rosemary, thyme, salt, and and pepper.<br>
                Stir well. Cook for 6-8 minutes, until the meat <br>
                is browned, stirring occasionally.<br>
            </li>
            <li>Add the Worcestershire sauce and garlic. Stir <br>
                to combine. Cook for 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Add the flour and tomato paste. Stir until well <br>
                incorporated and no clumps of tomato paste remain.</li>
            <li>Add the broth, frozen peas and carrots, and frozen corn. Bring the liquid to a boil <br>
            then reduce to simmer. Simmer for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Set the meat mixture aside. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Make the potato topping</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the potatoes in a large pot. Cover the potatoes with water. Bring the water to <br>
            a boil. Reduce to a simmer. Cook until potatoes are fork tender, 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Drain the potatoes in a colander. Return the potatoes to the hot pot. Let the <br>
            potatoes rest in the hot pot for 1 minute to evaporate any remaining liquid.</li>
            <li>Add butter, half & half, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Mash the potatoes and stir <br>
            until all the ingredients are mixed together.</li>
            <li>Add the parmesan cheese to the potatoes. Stir until well combined.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol>
            <li>Pour the meat mixture into a 9x9 (or 7x11) inch baking dish. Spread it out into an<br>
            even layer. Spoon the mashed potatoes on top of the meat. Carefully spread into<br>
            an even layer.</li>
            <li>If the baking dish looks very full, place it on a rimmed baking sheet so that the<br>
            filling doesnâ€™t bubble over into your oven. Bake uncovered for 25-30 minutes.** Cool <br>
            for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
